# 🧠 HypothesisAutoML

**HypothesisAutoML** is an interactive Streamlit app that transforms vague business or scientific hypotheses into testable logic using Groq-powered reasoning. It allows users to simulate hypothesis-based learning workflows by tagging feature correlations, generating synthetic datasets, and running explainable AutoML pipelines.

> ⚗️ From abstract ideas to structured, validated ML models — all in one interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Hypothesis Translation**: Converts vague logic into structured, machine-readable rules using Groq.
- 📊 **Correlation Tagging**: Tag features as highly, moderately, or weakly correlated with the target.
- 🧪 **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates custom datasets based on logical rules and correlations.
- 🤖 **AutoML Pipelines**: Runs classification and clustering using Scikit-Learn models.
- 🧠 **Explainability**: Built-in SHAP and LIME visualizations for model interpretation.
- 🧾 **Validation Layer**:
  - Logical rule satisfaction rate
  - Contrapositive inversion checks
  - Simulated scientist voting
- 📁 **Export to PDF**: Save generated insights and rule summaries with one click.
